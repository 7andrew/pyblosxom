	* docs/pyblosxom_manual.docbook: Spell-checked it.

2005-03-24 23:53  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/comments/plugins/comments.py: Added version and
	  author information.

2005-03-23 18:09  willhelm

	* README: Added a notice about the pb_pyblosxom.gif being available
	  on the new PyBlosxom site.

2005-03-23 18:07  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Changed the location of the Made
	  With PyBlosxom image in the default html templates to point to the
	  main PyBlosxom site (http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/).

2005-03-23 16:16  willhelm

	* docs/pyblosxom_manual.docbook: Moved the (empty) section on WSGI,
	  Twisted, and mod_python to the Advanced Installation chapter; added
	  a section on URL rewriting and changing pyblosxom.cgi to other
	  things.

2005-03-23 00:28  willhelm

	* docs/pyblosxom_manual.docbook: Added a section on
	  trouble-shooting (but it kind of sucks right now); added notes about
	  what datadir, plugin_dirs, and logdir should look like if you're
	  running in Windows.

2005-03-23 00:26  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Fixed the problem where static rendering
	  didn't really work on Windows machines.

2005-03-22 21:56  willhelm

	* docs/pyblosxom_manual.docbook: Fixed the problem where revhistory
	  wasn't rendering in HTML; minor cosmetic fixes.

2005-03-22 20:15  willhelm

	* docs/pyblosxom_manual.docbook: Changed the docbook version (4.1
	  -> 4.4); Added a subtitle; Moved the revhistory (fixed an error);
	  Added examples for date_head.html and date_foot.html; Added
	  information on weblog-add.py; Added default_flavour to the config.py
	  variables table

2005-03-22 00:24  willhelm

	* docs/pyblosxom_manual.docbook: Did some minor corrections here
	  and there.  Wrote the chapter on writing entries.

2005-03-21 19:14  willhelm

	* docs/pyblosxom_manual.docbook: Re-wrote the chapters on
	  installing and flavours.  I removed the chapter on configuration
	  (folded it into the chapter on installing).  I moved the config.py
	  variables table to the appendix.  I added copyright information and
	  the GFDL license.  There's still a lot to do, but it's getting
	  there.

2005-03-21 17:38  willhelm

	* README: Added a note about defaultFlavour -> default_flavour.

2005-03-21 17:37  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Changed "defaultFlavour" to
	  "default_flavour".  Trying to standardize the functionality on one
	  particularly property.

2005-03-21 17:35  willhelm

	* web/config.py: Added an item for default_flavour to the config.py
	  file.

2005-03-18 02:51  kaidon

	* README: Removed 'next' from the Request/Response method listings
	  as that's not available with Python 2.2.  Added notes that
	  sys.stdin/sys.stdout should not be accessed directly.  Added 'Usage'
	  examples for Request/Response as this is not documented anywhere
	  else yet.

2005-03-18 00:58  willhelm

	* README: Added Steven's notes on upgrading plugins from 1.1 to 1.2
	  and user-oriented changes from changelog notes.

2005-03-14 20:51  kaidon

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Fixed Request/Response to only use
	  StringIO methods that are available in Python 2.2.  Added
	  __future__.generators to imports for Python 2.2.  Renamed
	  _copy_members to __copy_members (make it private).

2005-03-14 17:28  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/entries/fileentry.py: Fixed generation of the
	  absolute_path so that it only replaces the first instance of the
	  datadir in the filename.  Thanks TheCrypto!

2005-03-14 17:16  willhelm

	* web/config.py: Changed "blog_author" so it's just the blog
	  author's name.  Added "blog_email".

2005-03-14 01:24  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/: pyblosxom.py, renderers/blosxom.py: Changed the way
	  we futz with blog_title.  Before we would change the blog_title
	  variable in the config dict to include the path of the PyBlosxom
	  request.  Some folks really disliked this practice.  On top of that,
	  we're now considering the config dict "read-only".

	  I changed it so that we create a new "blog_title_with_path" variable
	  in the data dict which is the blog title with the path.  If you want
	  just the blog title (with no path ever), use config["blog_title"].
	  If you want the blog title with the path, use
	  data["blog_title_with_path"].  This is a backwards-incompatible
	  change.

2005-03-14 00:50  willhelm

	* docs/pyblosxom_manual.docbook: Re-wrote the existing PyBlosxom
	  manual (the one that's on the web-site that was written in html) in
	  docbook.  This allows us to keep the manual version controlled and
	  release versions of the manual with PyBlosxom (should we decide to
	  do that sort of thing).

	  This conversion was pretty quick and dirty.  There might be typos,
	  minor style inconsistencies with docbook tags, mis-titled stuff, so
	  on and so forth.  And I didn't do any indexing kinds of things.

2005-03-12 04:06  twl

	* contrib/plugins/comments/plugins/: commentAPI.py, comments.py,
	  trackback.py, xmlrpc_pingback.py: Bring comments and related
	  plugins up to date with CVS - vs 1.2pre

2005-03-04 19:30  kaidon

	* Pyblosxom/: pyblosxom.py, tools.py: Fixed static rendering which
	  was broken by one of my previous changes.  Only buffer the input
	  stream in a StringIO instance if dynamic rendering is used.  This is
	  done to have a known/consistent way of accessing incomming data.
	  For example the input stream passed by mod_python does not offer the
	  same functionallity as sys.stdin.

2005-03-01 02:09  kaidon

	* web/pyblosxom.cgi: Fixed a stupid bug that happend while moving
	  code arround in the file.  Checked for env['REQUEST_METHOD'] instead
	  of os.environ['REQUEST_METHOD'].

2005-03-01 02:05  kaidon

	* web/: wsgi_app.py, pyblosxom.tac: Updated docstring. The url to
	  twisted_wsgi.py had changed.

2005-03-01 01:23  kaidon

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Fixed a bug which I introduced while
	  doing the Response/Request changes.  It caused the data dict to not
	  be recreated for every new request. This led to different requests
	  sharing the same data dict.  This had no implications on the cgi
	  version, but totaly hosed mod_python and twisted.

2005-02-25 12:29  kaidon

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Updated docstrings to reflect the changes
	  to Request/Response __iter__ and input stream buffer.

2005-02-25 12:21  kaidon

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Response and Request classes now inherit
	  from object. Added __iter__ methods to both classes.

	  The mod_python Request object doesn't offer the same methods like
	  for example sys.stdin. By wrapping/buffering the input stream in a
	  StringIO instance we get a consistent behaviour across all
	  environments.

2005-02-24 17:33  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/tools.py: Changed _walk_internal to __walk_internal.
	  Generally, "private" functions and methods should start with __.

2005-02-16 04:13  kaidon

	* web/pyblosxom.tac: Example tac file for running Pyblosxom on
	  twisted.

2005-02-16 02:43  kaidon

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Changed the Response class to not inherit
	  from object so it's possible to iterate over it.

2005-02-16 02:42  kaidon

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Changed the way how blog_title gets
	  modified in blosxom_process_path_info.  As twisted/mod_python may
	  cache it you otherwise end up with blog_title's like: $blog_title :
	  $pi_bl : $pi_bl : $pi_bl : $pi_bl : $pi_bl .... n Also removed
	  redundant code.

2005-02-15 23:40  kaidon

	* web/pyblosxom_wsgi.cgi: A WSGI version of pyblosxom.cgi.  This is
	  primarily interesting for testing and as a proof-of-concept.

2005-02-15 22:45  kaidon

	* web/pyblosxom.cgi: Added url_scheme handling for static
	  rendering.

2005-02-15 22:39  kaidon

	* web/wsgi_app.py: WSGI application launcher for Pyblosxom.  This
	  should be considered experimental and needs further testing.

2005-02-01 02:08  willhelm

	* contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/xmlrpc.py: Changes to xmlrpc to match the
	  new stdin/stdout stuff in PyBlosxom.  Thanks to Steven Armstrong for
	  putthing this all together.

2005-02-01 02:08  willhelm

	* web/pyblosxom.cgi: Changed pyblosxom.cgi to match the changes in
	  PyBlosxom regarding stdin and stdout.

2005-02-01 02:07  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/: pyblosxom.py, tools.py, renderers/base.py: This
	  checkin fixes problems with PyBlosxom and WSGI, mod_python, and
	  other frameworks that folks might want to use PyBlosxom in.  There
	  were several issues that are now resolved:

	    - we moved sucking stdin into cgi.FieldStorage to a later point so
	      that WDGI, mod_python, and other frameworks work
	    - we no longer spit things out to stdout--we have a new Response
	      object which wraps an output stream which in some cases is
	      stdout and in others is the preferred output stream for the
	      framework involved

	  I think that's about it for major changes.  A big big thanks to
	  Steven Armstrong who put this all together, tested it, and pushed it
	  through.

2005-01-22 17:22  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Minor adjustment to nicify the changes I
	  just made previously.

	  (Is nicify a word?  It should be.)

2005-01-22 15:24  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: If the user doesn't set num_entries, we
	  should treat it as if they set it to 0.  So I fixed the code to do
	  that.

2005-01-08 21:56  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/tools.py: Committing fixes to the logging functions.
	  (Thanks Steven)

2005-01-05 22:07  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Preparing for a release.  Also includes
	  changes to how we deal with the http dict.  This fixed an issue with
	  running PyBlosxom under ...  mod_python I think.  Sorry for the lack
	  of information here.

2005-01-05 22:06  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: I don't remember why this is
	  changed, but I have vague memories it's a patch that fixed some
	  problem.  Sorry for the total lack of information here.

2005-01-05 22:06  willhelm

	* setup.py: Preparing for a release.

2004-09-27 22:36  rwall

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Remove code that limits the

	  num_entries has been set to zero

2004-09-02 19:38  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Applying Robert's fix so we don't
	  pick up config files accidentally and think it's a flavour file.

2004-08-21 18:30  willhelm

	* contrib/flavour_examples/: foot.1993, head.atom, head.code,
	  story.atom: Made a bunch of changes to the existing contributed

	  files.  Thanks James for the suggestion.

2004-06-16 17:49  wari

	  to use os.sep.

2004-06-04 03:06  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/entries/fileentry.py: Oops--I still don't fully
	  understand what self._root is.  I added another "root" which is the
	  datadir.  Silliness....

2004-06-04 02:41  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/entries/fileentry.py: Fixed a flaw in FileEntry where
	  it was looking at the datadir rather than the root that's passed in
	  via the constructor.  Also added another munge so it correctly
	  figures out the absolute_path regardless of whether the root ends in
	  an os.sep or not.

2004-06-04 00:20  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/comments/plugins/comments.py: Fixed the problem

	  contrib/plugins/comments/plugins/trackback.py,
	  contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/xmlrpc_metaweblog.py: Added a "logdir"

	  and if they have it renders the entry in all the static_flavours and
	  also the index page in all the static_flavours.

2004-05-13 00:07  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Added "encoding="$blog_encoding""

	  tools.render_url--it's a more accurate name for what it's doing.

2004-05-12 04:26  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/: pyblosxom.py, tools.py: I had a long discussion with
	  Lion the conclusion of which was that my lambda functions are
	  abstract and complex and hard to read.  So I'm toying with
	  alternatives to make the code clearer.

2004-05-11 17:38  willhelm

	* INSTALL: Overhauled the INSTALL text basing it off of my latest
	  "simplified" install instructions.

2004-05-10 10:22  twl

	  the staticrender_filelist callback.  I figure everyone will have to
	  extract it so we might as well pass it around and make it easier to
	  centralize default static_flavours.

2004-05-07 21:44  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py, Pyblosxom/tools.py,
	  docs/ReadMeForPlugins.py: Lots of fixes to the static renderer.
	  Added a "staticrenderer_filelist" callback so that plugins can
	  specify additional urls that need to be built.  Also updated the
	  documentation for cb_start and cb_end and moved where cb_end gets
	  called in pyblosxom.py to match Ted's fixes to cb_start.

	* ChangeLog: update my mail address

2004-05-07 11:25  twl

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Call start callbacks in initialize -
	  restore callback order to where it was before common_start was
	  removed -- this broke commentAPI, trackback and pingback.

2004-05-06 23:46  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Backing out the change I did to
	  limit what entries we were escaping.

2004-05-06 22:40  willhelm

	* setup.py: Un-hardcoded where contrib and web files go.  (bug
	  823459--Thanks to syt)

2004-05-06 21:34  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Adjusted escaping of entries for
	  RSS feeds.  I made it really specific so that we only escape the
	  content for entries for content-type "text/xml" and that's it.  This
	  should fix the problem people are having when they go to create an
	  XHTML 1.1 compliant flavour.

2004-05-06 19:17  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/comments/plugins/comments.py: Fixed the
	  "no_comments" to "nocomments" property so it can be used in entries.

2004-05-04 22:53  willhelm

	* web/pyblosxom.cgi: Added an --incremental flag for static
	  rendering.

2004-05-04 22:53  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: All of this is related to static
	  rendering....  Added an incremental flag so that you can opt to do a
	  full render or an incremental render.  Fixed arbitrary urls so that
	  we handle query strings appropriately.  Adjusted how we use the
	  request object so we don't recycle it every time around (in case
	  some plugins are messy).

2004-05-04 22:51  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/tools.py: Added some more HTTP things.

2004-05-04 17:14  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Adjusted the HTML templates again
	  to use h1, h2, and h3.

2004-05-04 17:11  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Removed RSS3 and ESF default
	  flavours.  Adjusted the HTML flavour so that it validates as valid
	  HTML 4.01 transitional (though it's missing the doctype and things
	  of that nature).

2004-05-03 17:15  willhelm

	* docs/ReadMeForPlugins.py: Docs edits.

2004-05-03 04:20  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/comments/: README, plugins/comments.py,
	  plugins/trackback.py, plugins/xmlrpc_pingback.py: Moved
	  pingback.py to plugins/xmlrpc_pingback.py.  Overhauled the
	  documentation in README.  Fixed outgoing email notifications.  Fixed
	  the "num_entries" (didn't show up in the comments-story templates)
	  variable.  Overhauled the documentation at the top of comments.py.

2004-05-03 04:18  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Fixed the _getFlavour method to
	  prevent what I'm pretty sure would sometimes be an infinite loop.

2004-05-01 01:32  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Applied Nathan's patch (with some
	  slight modifications) to fix nested flavours so that they apply to
	  child directories as well as the directory the flavour templates are
	  in.

2004-05-01 01:21  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Removed lots of commented out code.

2004-04-30 00:26  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/comments/plugins/comments.py: Documentation
	  changes.  Removed the blosxom_custom_flavours handling code (we
	  don't need it anymore).

2004-04-30 00:25  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/: pyblosxom.py, tools.py: Changes to the static
	  rendering code.  I moved the render_entry code to the tools module
	  so that it can be called by plugins that need to re-render a
	  specific page.

2004-04-30 00:24  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Re-wrote _getFlavour (for the
	  most part) to fix a bug with templates in the directory being looked
	  at overriding templates in the datadir for single entries being
	  displayed.

	  I also ditched the blosxom_custom_flavours config property--we don't
	  need it anymore since we're searching for templates by taste rather
	  than by template flavour name (i.e. by "html" instead of by
	  "content-type|head|story|foot...").

2004-04-26 22:22  willhelm

	* web/: config.py, pyblosxom.cgi: Checking in changes to config.py
	  and pyblosxom.cgi in regards to static rendering.  Forgot to check
	  them in on Saturday.

2004-04-24 17:16  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Fixed some minor static rendering bugs
	  and finished it up.  It now renders entries, the categories the
	  entries are in, and the dates as well.  On top of that, it does an
	  incremental rendering--so if an entry hasn't been updated, it won't
	  get re-rendered.

2004-04-24 05:30  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/: plugin_utils.py, pyblosxom.py, tools.py: Fixed a
	  minor bug in plugin_utils--if you called initialize() twice, then
	  we'd end up with the plugins in the callback chains twice which
	  totally screwed things up.  Added a first rev of static rendering.
	  It does entries and categories, but doesn't do date-based stuff yet.
	  Fixed a bug in tools regarding the ignorere stuff I added earlier.

2004-04-24 03:03  willhelm

	* web/config.py: Added the "ignore_directories" property and
	  associated comments.

2004-04-24 03:01  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/tools.py: Added an "ignore_directories" property for
	  config.py which will force the ignoring of entire directories (and
	  their contents).  Added ignoring of any directories that start with
	  a period.

2004-04-24 01:59  willhelm

	* pyunittest.py, setup.py, Pyblosxom/Request.py,
	  Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py, Pyblosxom/renderers/base.py,
	  contrib/plugins/firstdaydiv.py,
	  contrib/plugins/preformatters/moinmoin.py,
	  contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/xmlrpc.py, web/pyblosxom.cgi: Moved the
	  Request to pyblosxom.  Fixed a bug I created in pyblosxom.cgi.

2004-04-24 01:27  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/: pyblosxom.py, testinstallation.py, tools.py,
	  xmlrpc.py, cache/__init__.py, entries/__init__.py,
	  renderers/__init__.py, renderers/blosxom.py: Added some "pass" to
	  the __init__.py files.  It's just cosmetic.  Made a bunch of changes
	  to pyblosxom.py fixing the whole common_start thing, adjusting the
	  start and end callbacks so they only apply to the blosxom_handler
	  (they shouldn't affect the other handlers), moving the common_start
	  stuff to initialize so that we have one initialize method, ...

	  Moved the testinstallation code to pyblosxom.py.

	  Removed xmlrpc.py because we don't use it.

	  Fixed variable parsing in templates so that we pass around the
	  request object.  I'm not sure why we didn't do this before...  I'd
	  have to think about it.

2004-04-21 23:10  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Added "pyblosxom_version" as a template
	  variable that points to VERSION_DATE.

2004-04-20 22:25  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/pyarchives.py: Added a "B".

2004-04-20 21:58  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/pyarchives.py: Fixed some code in pyarchives that
	  didn't work in Python 2.1.

	  Thanks to Wilhelm Fitzpatrick for finding the problem and helping to
	  fix it.

2004-04-19 22:09  willhelm

	* MANIFEST.in: Added flavour_examples files to MANIFEST.in so they
	  get picked up in the distribution.

2004-04-14 19:25  willhelm

	* web/config.py: Fixed the config file.

2004-04-13 16:32  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: I adjusted the VERSION_SPLIT tuple so
	  that it parses the VERSION per Wari's suggestion.  Originally I
	  wasn't going to do this because I thought that VERSION might include
	  something like "pre-0.9.1" while the VERSION_SPLIT would be (0, 9,
	  1).  But after thinking about it, I'm not sure this would happen any
	  time soon.  So might as well make it easier now.  We can always
	  change it back later.

2004-04-13 05:56  wari

	* Pyblosxom/tools.py: Fixed walk so that it silently returns an
	  empty array on exceptions.

	  Modified Files:
	  	Pyblosxom/tools.py

2004-04-07 17:44  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/: pyblosxom.py, testinstallation.py: Added a
	  VERSION_DATE to pyblosxom module.  Added display of the VERSION_DATE
	  to the testinstallation module so that the user can figure out what
	  they're running more easily.

2004-04-07 17:40  willhelm

	* setup.py, Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Moved the version number to
	  pyblosxom.py so that it can be accessed by the plugins.  I also
	  added a "version split" which is a tuple indicating the version
	  number so that plugins can indicate whether they will work with the
	  installed version of Pyblosxom or not.

2004-04-06 01:36  willhelm

	* INSTALL: Minor changes to INSTALL guide.

2004-04-04 21:19  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/tools.py: Fixed the logging function for non 2.3
	  installation so that it acts more like the logging module's logging
	  function.

2004-04-04 20:24  willhelm

	* contrib/entryparsers/txtl.py: Updated textile plugin from Roberto
	  De Almeida.  It's updated for PyTextile 2.0.

2004-04-04 17:35  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/pycategories.py: Fixes a bug with categories and
	  the case where a directory name may appear multiple times in the
	  tree hierarchy.

2004-04-01 04:46  wari

	* contrib/editfile.py: Updated to use os.spawnl instead of
	  os.system which /may/ be dangerous in a security point of view.

	  Thanks to Chad Miller for this http://web.chad.org/weblog/

	  Modified Files:
	  	editfile.py

2004-03-31 20:11  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/cache/: base.py, entryshelve.py: Fixed a bug in
	  entryshelve that prevented it from working.  Minor argument change
	  in base.py: request -> req.

2004-03-31 10:53  twl

	* contrib/plugins/comments/plugins/comments.py: Correct typo in
	  error message

2004-03-24 21:47  willhelm

	* MANIFEST.in: Added all the pieces that the comments plugin
	  requires (i.e. the README and the flavour files).

2004-03-24 21:47  willhelm

	* docs/__init__.py: [no log message]

2004-03-24 21:44  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/comments/plugins/comments.py: Fixing minor
	  verify_installation bug in comments.py where checking for whether
	  the optional properties existed required a "not".

2004-03-24 19:56  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/testinstallation.py: Fixed a bug wherein we were
	  passing the wrong values to initialize_plugins.  This caused it to
	  think that no plugins were being loaded when the load_plugins config
	  property wasn't set.

2004-03-18 01:22  willhelm

	* INSTALL: Minor adjustments--added the verify installation step.

2004-03-18 01:21  willhelm

	* INSTALL: Modifications to the INSTALL file.

2004-03-18 01:20  willhelm

2004-03-17 00:28  twl

	* contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/xmlrpc_metaweblog.py: Improve
	  documentation of options

2004-03-16 22:02  twl

2004-03-10 02:17  willhelm

	* docs/ReadMeForPlugins.py: More minor adjustments.

2004-03-10 02:14  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/tools.py, Pyblosxom/cache/base.py,
	  docs/ReadMeForPlugins.py: Documentation fixes.

2004-03-10 00:51  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/: tools.py, renderers/blosxom.py: Fixed Replacer and
	  parse so they no longer require the Request object.  (They were only
	  using the Request object to retrieve the blog_encoding property.)
	  Minor adjustments to Walk to speed it up a little.  Walk now handles
	  some of the up-front checking of the inputs and then calls
	  _walk_internal which recurses.

2004-03-10 00:49  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/plugin_utils.py: Removed a FIXME--we should raise an
	  exception if one of the plugindirs is not there.

2004-03-08 23:58  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Oops--missed a space.  That'll teach me
	  not to test things before I check them in.  (naughty Will!)

2004-03-08 22:31  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Added the runCallback method to the
	  PyBlosxom object for Lance to enable his command-line callback
	  stuff.

2004-03-06 04:04  twl

	* contrib/autoping.py: Fix to use new plugin architecture Replace
	  prints with tools.log

2004-03-04 21:29  willhelm

	* setup.py, Pyblosxom/testinstallation.py: Fixed a bug in setup.py
	  noticed by Lance.  Minor adjustment to the testinstallation script
	  to print out the plugin __version__ if there is any.

2004-03-02 16:54  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/: pyarchives.py, pycalendar.py, pycategories.py:
	  Added verify_installation functions to these three plugins.

2004-03-02 16:44  willhelm

	* setup.py: Changed the code involving which platform the user is
	  running PyBlosxom on to make it easier to edit (when we discover new
	  platforms) and also does some looser checking for linux, freebsd,
	  and openbsd since all the versions of those are likely to be "nix"
	  oriented.

2004-03-02 16:38  willhelm

	* contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/xmlrpc_blogger.py: Encoding problem fixed.

2004-02-27 08:03  twl

2004-02-24 09:52  twl

	* contrib/flavour_examples/: content_type.atom, foot.atom,
	  head.atom, story.atom: Add atom 0.3 flavour

2004-02-23 10:16  twl

	* contrib/plugins/comments/: commentAPI.cgi, trackback.cgi: Remove
	  unnecessary cgi scripts

2004-02-23 10:14  twl

	* contrib/plugins/comments/plugins/: commentAPI.py, trackback.py:
	  Migrate comments/feedback system to new URL handling architecture

2004-02-23 03:03  twl

	* contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/xmlrpc_blogger.py: Implement
	  blogger.deletePost - use at your own risk

2004-02-22 02:46  twl

	* contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/xmlrpc_blogger.py: Add a configuration
	  flag to control behavior when used in conjunction with metaweblog
	  API

	* contrib/plugins/comments/plugins/comments.py: Fix for
	  blasterattacko comment SMTP exploit

2004-02-20 01:25  willhelm

	* ChangeLog: Oops--totally forgot about the ChangeLog for 8
	  months....  I tried to update it based on cvs checkin comments since
	  last June.

2004-02-20 00:54  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py, Pyblosxom/testinstallation.py,
	  docs/README.plugins, docs/ReadMeForPlugins.py, web/pyblosxom.cgi:
	  Minor documentation changes.

	  Added a testinstallation mode that allows someone who has just
	  installed pyblosxom to run "python pyblosxom.cgi" and it'll check
	  their config file for required items, load all their plugins, and
	  query each plugin (via verify_installation function) as to whether
	  the plugin is configured correctly.  This should take a lot of the
	  mystery and annoyance out of installation and configuration of
	  PyBlosxom and plugins that correctly implement the "interface".

2004-02-19 17:42  willhelm

	* web/: config.py, pyblosxom.cgi: Added a "codebase" parameter to
	  the config.py which allows users to point pyblosxom.cgi to their
	  PyBlosxom installation without having to fiddle with the
	  pyblosxom.cgi script.  Removed the xmlrpc configuration stuff from
	  config.py.

2004-02-18 22:13  willhelm

	* contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/xmlrpcexamples.py: Fixed to use the new
	  methodology.

2004-02-18 16:36  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/plugin_utils.py: I'm thinking that eventually we'll
	  start to have plugins that act as a library of functions for other
	  plugins to use.  As such, we needed an easy way to get the plugin
	  module instance for other plugins.  The get_plugin_by_name does
	  this.  It'll return the Python module instance for a plugin that
	  we've imported.

2004-02-18 16:35  willhelm

	* contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/: xmlrpc.py, xmlrpc_blogger.py: Adjusted
	  the xmlrpc dispatcher configuration so that it doesn't use its own
	  dict and uses the regular plugins list for other xmlrpc plugins.
	  Adjusted xmlrpc_blogger fixing the authentication stuff which was
	  borked.

2004-02-18 01:19  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Added a defaultHandler and separated out
	  the code a smidge.

2004-02-18 01:07  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/logstats.py: Fix to the logstats.py plugin so
	  that it now works when you go to view the referrers page.

2004-02-18 01:07  willhelm

	* web/xmlrpc.cgi: Removed the xmlrpc.cgi--the functionality
	  implemented here has been implemented in an xmlrpc dispatcher plugin
	  (see contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/xmlrpc.py).

2004-02-18 01:04  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/plugin_utils.py, Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py,
	  contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/blogger.py,
	  contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/xmlrpc.py,
	  contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/xmlrpc_blogger.py: Removed the existing
	  xmlrpc stuff and replaced it with an xmlrpc dispatcher plugin and an
	  xmlrpc blogger plugin.

	  Added a handle callback.  All plugins that implement the handle
	  callback get the Pyblosxom request and can do whatever they want
	  with it.  If they handle the request, they should return a 1.

	  See contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/xmlrpc.py as an example of a plugin that
	  handles the request completely--note this involves not going through
	  the rest of the Pyblosxom lifecycle so you can return whatever HTTP
	  response you want.

	  Moved the FieldStorage creation from pyblosxom.cgi to
	  pyblosxom.Pyblosxom.run after all the plugins have had a chance to
	  handle the request.

	  xmlrpc plugins now register their methods via a callback which only
	  gets called when the xmlrpc plugin wants to handle an xmlrpc
	  request.  Implement the cb_xmlrpc_register callback to register
	  methods.  For an example, look at
	  contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/xmlrpc_blogger.py.

	  Retooled the tools.initialize_plugins method to make it so we can
	  call it multiple times with different plugin lists and plugin dirs.
	  This allows xmlrpc plugins to be initialized later on in the cycle
	  since we probably don't want them showing up in plugininfo since
	  that could alert someone to the fact that the blogger API is
	  implemented and then maybe they'll want to try to post to your blog.

2004-02-17 22:44  willhelm

	* web/pyblosxom.cgi: Moved the cgi field storage stuff to
	  pyblosxom.Pyblosxom.pyblosxom.run so that xmlrpc can work as a
	  Pyblosxom plugin (or any other plugin that would want to absorb
	  stdin).

2004-02-15 23:51  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Minor adjustments to the default
	  story template so that it makes a bit more sense out of the box.
	  Changed the name of flavour_name to template_name for the override
	  for individual entries that indicates which template to use to
	  render the entry.

2004-02-15 23:49  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/tools.py: Added some more details to the donefunc part
	  of the run_callback function.

2004-02-15 23:34  willhelm

	* pyunittest.py: Commented out the locking test case--it needs to
	  be re-written.

2004-02-15 19:34  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/Request.py: Added a __repr__ method.

2004-02-15 19:00  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/logstats.py: Added file locking to the data file.

2004-02-15 18:44  willhelm

	* docs/LICENSE.portalocker: Added the LICENSE text for the
	  portalocker code which is in the tools module.

2004-02-15 18:43  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/tools.py: Removed the old locking stuff and replaced it
	  with the portalocker code from the Python Cookbook.  Minor
	  adjustments to the logger functions replacing variable name
	  instances of "file" with "filename".

2004-02-13 10:01  twl

	  contrib/plugins/logstats.py, contrib/plugins/pycategories.py,
	  contrib/plugins/lucene/bin/BlosxomIndexer.java: Removed instances
	  of using "file", "list", and "dict" as a variablenames.  Fixed
	  pycategories so it has the correct behavior when entries are in the
	  root directory.

	  overhaul involving removal of the tools.get_registry function and
	  adding the Request object as an input argument to most of the
	  callbacks.  All the other changes were the result of fallout from
	  these changes.

2004-01-27 17:53  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Minor documentation change so that I can
	  test the syncmail stuff.

2004-01-25 08:06  twl

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py, contrib/plugins/comments/commentAPI.cgi,
	  contrib/plugins/comments/trackback.cgi,
	  contrib/plugins/comments/plugins/comments.py: Refactor
	  pybloxom.py to create common_start method for use by other CGI's
	  Update comment system to use this method.

2004-01-23 02:21  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Fixed a bug in the rendering of
	  templates where the entry overrides the flavour.

2004-01-22 00:27  willhelm

	* pyunittest.py, Pyblosxom/tools.py: Added a has_lock method so
	  that something can tell whether it has the lock or not.  Fixed
	  pyunittest so that it worked correctly.

2004-01-22 00:16  willhelm

	* pyunittest.py, Pyblosxom/tools.py: Added a get_lock and a
	  return_lock to tools.py to be used for synchronizing (via the file
	  system) on datafile resources.  Added a pyunittest module which
	  should be used for unit testing standalone static functions in the
	  Pyblosxom framework.

2004-01-21 23:02  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/: tools.py, entries/base.py: Moved the generate_entry
	  helper function to tools.py and added some more documentation to it.

2004-01-21 19:55  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/logstats.py: I made a lot of changes to the
	  logstats plugin adding a "detailed" page for referrers listing.
	  This doesn't really change the basic things the logstats plugin
	  does, but it does lay the groundwork for the ability to do a
	  detailed report on the data.

2004-01-17 08:15  twl

	* contrib/plugins/pycategories.py: Fix a the double root bug

2004-01-15 02:53  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/entries/base.py: Added a generic generate_entry method
	  which allows you to generate an arbitrary entry from a properties
	  dict and a data string.

2004-01-11 10:23  twl

	* contrib/entryparsers/txtl.py: Patch from Tollef Fog Heen
	  http://raw.no/personal/blog/tech/2004-01-11-02-47_pyblosxom.html

2004-01-07 16:29  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py: Moved the default functions out of the
	  Pyblosxom class and into the module.  There really isn't a reason
	  they should belong in the Pyblosxom class and it's possible someone
	  might want to use them in a plugin.  I'm tossing around moving them
	  to the tools module.

2004-01-02 02:53  twl

	* contrib/plugins/lucene/lucene.py: Update documentation for Lucene
	  1.3 and Mac OS X

2004-01-02 02:44  twl

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py,
	  contrib/plugins/comments/plugins/comments.py,
	  docs/ReadMeForPlugins.py: Add cb_story_end, to allow actions to
	  occur after the story template has been substututed.

	  This is needed to fix a potential scripting attack via comments --
	  if the commentor enters text using $ they can access entry and
	  config variables.

	  The patches to comments.py use cb_story end to solve this problem.

2003-09-25 17:17  willhelm

	* setup.cfg, setup.py, Pyblosxom/tools.py: Added a platform
	  (cygwin).  Added force_manifest to the setup.cfg file so it forces a
	  manifest rebuild every time we run it.

2003-09-15 14:02  wari

	* INSTALL: Latest install guide from the wiki

2003-09-05 15:56  willhelm

2003-09-05 01:43  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/pycategories.py: Fixed the category list so that
	  it doesn't include directories that have no items in them.  In doing
	  that, I took out a tools.Walk and some additional processing that
	  really didn't need to be there.

2003-08-28 08:52  wari

	* contrib/plugins/pyarchives.py: Added Kai's changes for
	  pyarchives.py (Thanks Kai)

2003-08-28 08:23  wari

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Functionality of config override

2003-08-18 14:05  wari

	* contrib/: weblog-add.py, entryparsers/py.py: Updated to more
	  XHTML compliant-ly

2003-08-14 11:14  wari

	* Pyblosxom/xmlrpc.py, web/xmlrpc.cgi: We now use
	  sys.stdout.write() for xmlrpc services, as using print will produce
	  side effects, like appending a \n or \r\n at the end of the string.

2003-08-14 09:18  twl

	* contrib/: flavour_examples/story.html, plugins/comments/README,
	  plugins/comments/flavours/comment-story.html: Move trackback

	  Wari's name and email address.

2003-08-11 04:01  wari

	* contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/blogger.py: Last few bits of Win32
	  compatibility

2003-08-09 01:31  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/tools.py: Changed the way we handle variable arguments.
	  We now handle anything that is a valid python argument list
	  (arguments, keyword arguments, no arguments, ...).

2003-08-08 06:29  willhelm

	* MANIFEST.in, setup.cfg, setup.py: Fixed the error with bdist_rpm
	  and the ellusive web files.

2003-08-08 06:04  willhelm

	* MANIFEST.in: Adding the MANIFEST.in file.  This specifies all the

2003-08-07 16:15  willhelm

	* setup.py: os.path.normpath is a better version of fixf, used that
	  instead

2003-08-07 00:40  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/: plugin_utils.py, pyblosxom.py: Added some "global"
	  statements to plugin_utils.

	  Adjusted our handling of the datadir so that we strip any trailing
	  os.sep on the datadir.  It will always look like "/path/to/blog"
	  now.  In doing this, I discovered we weren't calling
	  Pyblosxom.startup.  I suspect this was an error, so I injected it
	  into the startup callback mechanism.  It works fine on my blog, but
	  I'm not entirely sure what adverse effects it might have elsewhere
	  with all those fine and fancy things everyone else is doing.

2003-08-07 00:38  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/pycalendar.py: Re-fixed the issue where thismonth
	  is outside of the range of keys that we have.  I think this is the
	  desired behavior we're looking for.

2003-08-06 18:30  wari

	* Pyblosxom/tools.py, Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py,
	  web/config.py: iso-8859-1 is valid after all

2003-08-06 05:37  wari

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/debug.py: Allow the debug renderer to display
	  a lot more keys that are available to the user

2003-08-05 18:07  wari

2003-08-05 18:05  wari

	* contrib/plugins/pycalendar.py: Hotfix when items in keys are not
	  in thismonth. Will, what should we do? if this is ok, FIXME comments
	  should be removed.

2003-08-01 08:11  wari

	* contrib/plugins/pycalendar.py:
	  (x)html compliance fix

2003-08-01 05:15  wari

	* setup.py: In Singapore we call this kind of cluelessness 'Blur'

2003-08-01 04:51  wari

	* setup.py: I really do like that Dear Wari bit :)

2003-08-01 04:28  willhelm

	* setup.py: I got everything on Wari's todo list with the following
	  minor issues:

	  1. adding the web scripts to the scripts directive will kick
	     distutils into changing the shebang line.  however, it then also
	     copies the files to /usr/local/bin--probably not something we want
	  to do.
	  2. i can't figure out how to modify the sys.path in the web scripts
	     if PyBlosxom is not in the PYTHONPATH.
	  3. it's only been tested on Linux.

2003-07-29 08:55  wari

	* Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py: Private != protected. __foo makes
	  it harder to make subclasses of

2003-07-29 05:58  wari

	* setup.py, contrib/mt2blosxom.py, contrib/weblog-add.py,

2003-07-23 17:27  wari

2003-07-23 17:19  wari

	* Pyblosxom/tools.py, Pyblosxom/renderers/blosxom.py,

2003-07-15 20:09  twl

	* contrib/plugins/w3cdate.py: Change to cb_story, clean up TZ
	  handling some more

2003-07-15 12:45  wari

	* contrib/autoping.py: Ensure that autoping is not extension
	  specific, as well as remove painful defaults from the autoping
	  script

2003-07-15 04:11  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/: pyarchives.py, pycalendar.py: Adjusted to use

	  values.

2003-07-15 04:10  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/: tools.py, entries/fileentry.py: Added a filestat
	  function to the tools library which caches filestat calls on
	  filenames.  We seem to filestat files multiple times in a given
	  Pyblosxom run--this will cache what we've gotten so we don't have to
	  do the filestat callback over and over again for the same file.

2003-07-10 05:35  willhelm

2003-06-24 11:54  wari

	* config.py, pyblosxom.cgi, xmlrpc.cgi: So long, and thanks for all
	  the fish :)

2003-06-24 11:47  wari

	* LICENSE: Added the MIT license

2003-06-24 11:37  wari

	* contrib/xmlrpc_plugins/: blogger.py, xmlrpcexamples.py: Initial
	  neo pyblosxom xmlrpcplugins import

2003-06-24 11:26  wari

	* Pyblosxom/: plugin_utils.py, xmlrpc.py:

	  * refactored part of the initialize plugins as well

	  * authenticate, which was part of xmlrpcplugins.__init__ is moved to
	  xmlrpc.py

2003-06-24 11:22  wari

	* web/config.py: Updated configuration to reflect the latest plugin
	  information

2003-06-17 06:16  wari

	* ChangeLog, setup.py, Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py,
	  docs/ReadMeForPlugins.py: Updated renderers to be pluggable via
	  the cb_renderer callback so that simple blosxom renderer changes (or
	  even complex ones) are a callback away :)

2003-06-07 22:09  willhelm

	* Pyblosxom/: __init__.pyc, plugin_utils.py, pyblosxom.py,
	  tools.py, tools.pyc: Removed some .pyc files that accidentally
	  made it into the repository.  Fixed the plugin system.  We now have
	  two keys that are involved in plugins being loaded:

	    plugin_dirs - a list of strings that dictate which directories
	         (they should be full path names--not relative ones) hold
	         Pyblosxom plugins.

	    load_plugins - the list of plugins to load from those directories.
	         If this isn't specified (it's optional), then we load all the
	         plugins we can find (except ones that start with _) in
	         alphabetical order.  If it is specified then we load only
	         the plugins listed and we load them in the order they're
	         listed.

	  Other than that, it's business as usual.

	   * Update the plugins that uses tools.logRequest to
	   run_callback('log_request')
	  * Plugins that uses os.environ.get() is updated to use
	  request.getHttp() dicts

2003-03-26 16:50  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/: conditionalhttp.py, firstdaydiv.py,
	  logrequest.py, logstats.py, pyarchives.py, pycalendar.py,
	  pycategories.py, pyfilenamemtime.py, weblogsping.py: Overhaul
	  with how callbacks are implemented.  Before we had an
	  active-registration callback system.  Plugins would have an
	  initialize function which would get called when they were imported.
	  In this function they would register with various api callback
	  chains.

	  Then through PyBlosxom's life cycle we would call either
	  executeHandler, executeListHandler, or executeTransform on these
	  chains.  The three different execute* methods differed in how they
	  proceeded through the chain and what they did with input and output.

	  The new callback system is a passive-registration system.  When the
	  plugin is imported, we catalogue all the functions with names that
	  start with cb_ (for callback).  We build the listing of callbacks
	  and their function lists on the fly--so adding a new callback
	  consists of no steps whatsoever short of calling run_callback with
	  the new callback and creating a plugin that has the cb_callbackname
	  function.

	  We've replaced the execute* methods with an all-powerful
	  run_callback function in tools.py.  It allows for unique behavior in
	  how it maps the output of one function to the input of the next
	  function as well as how to determine whether we're done processing.
	  These make it far more powerful than the previous execute* methods
	  since we can essentially do anything we want.  It also adds the idea
	  of a defaultfunction which will get called if we've finished running
	  through all the functions in the callback chain and we haven't
	  satisfied the donefunc conditions.  It might look a little
	  complicated, but it's super duper powerful and fairly well
	  documented.

2003-03-25 00:08  willhelm

	* ChangeLog, config.py: Adjusted the ChangeLog adding an entry
	  about the new plugin loading behavior.  Adjusted the notes in

2003-03-14 04:31  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/: pycalendar.py, pycategories.py: Adjusted my
	  email address.

2003-03-11 02:18  twl

	* contrib/plugins/lucene/lucene.py: adapt to new architecture

2003-03-08 03:47  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/pycalendar.py: Moved some pieces that were in
	  defaultFileEntryList over to the run method because they setup the
	  data dict and we need them if plugins are to generate data as well.
	  Fixed pieces of pycalendar so it works even when everything isn't
	  perfect.  Fixed blosxom.py so that it uses get/setData.

2003-03-01 15:30  willhelm

	* ChangeLog, config.py: Changed how we import plugins.  Now we
	  import only the plugins listed in "load_plugins" in the config dict.
	  We default to loading no plugins whatsoever.  Plugins must live in
	  the libs/plugins directory (the libs.plugins Python package).
	  Plugins are loaded in the order specified in the "load_plugins"
	  list.

2003-02-25 09:26  twl

	* contrib/plugins/lucene/lucene.py: remove dependency on
	  cgi.FieldStorage

2003-02-25 08:19  twl

	* contrib/plugins/lucene/lucene.py: Update to work with request
	  class

2003-02-25 08:18  twl

	* contrib/plugins/logstats.py: Must set config also

2003-02-24 18:48  bwinton

	* contrib/plugins/firstdaydiv.py: Fix typos and logic errors

2003-02-24 15:26  wari

	* contrib/plugins/logstats.py: Fixed bad_list when there's not list
	  and some minor code cleanup

2003-02-24 14:19  wari

	* contrib/plugins/conditionalhttp.py: Minor indentation fix.
	  conditionalhttp wasn't working at all

2003-02-23 18:41  wari

	* contrib/plugins/logstats.py: Fixed minor error in code concerning
	  Request()

2003-02-23 17:25  wari

	* contrib/plugins/weblogsping.py, contrib/plugins/logstats.py,
	  pyblosxom.cgi: Minor bug fixes on code that does not work during
	  the migration of py[] to Request object.

2003-02-23 16:13  wari

	* contrib/entryparsers/py.py: Updated the use of cache to look like
	  the code is using a normal dict. Also fixed py.py entryparser so
	  that it uses request instead of py[]

2003-02-22 22:42  willhelm

	* pyblosxom.cgi: Aha!  Fixed the problem with the entries not
	  reflecting the request.

2003-02-22 17:55  willhelm

	* pyblosxom.cgi, contrib/plugins/conditionalhttp.py,
	  contrib/plugins/firstdaydiv.py, contrib/plugins/logstats.py,
	  contrib/plugins/pyarchives.py, contrib/plugins/pycalendar.py,
	  contrib/plugins/pycategories.py,
	  contrib/plugins/pyfilenamemtime.py,
	  contrib/plugins/weblogsping.py: Overhauled the code-base to use
	  the new Request object.  The code is not likely all that bug-free at
	  the moment--so be warned.

	  I also removed the plugins.__init__.load mechanism and replaced it
	  with the api.prepareChain.  The prepareChain gives plugins a chance
	  to adjust the data dict and the entry list prior to rendering.

	  On top of that, I did a bad thing and combined some formatting
	  changes by converting tabs to spaces in files where I noticed it.

2003-02-22 01:52  bwinton

	* config.py:

	  Add documentation and example for the newly-overridable
	  py['base_url'] variable.

2003-02-17 10:24  wari

	* contrib/plugins/logstats.py: Fixed situation where bad_list was
	  not assigned which results in error

2003-02-17 01:49  twl

	* contrib/plugins/logstats.py: Fix counting bugs remove check from
	  addReferer - preserve all information

2003-02-16 17:51  wari

	* contrib/plugins/: statusnotfound.py, weblogsping.py: Moved
	  statusnotfound.py plugin to be a default behaviour when entryList is
	  empty

2003-02-16 09:19  wari

	* ChangeLog, contrib/plugins/conditionalhttp.py,
	  contrib/plugins/firstdaydiv.py, contrib/plugins/logstats.py,
	  contrib/plugins/pyarchives.py, contrib/plugins/pycalendar.py,
	  contrib/plugins/pycategories.py,
	  contrib/plugins/statusnotfound.py,
	  contrib/plugins/weblogsping.py: Updated plugin code to support
	  renderers as well and 2 renderers now, blosxom and debug renderer.

2003-02-14 02:51  willhelm

	* config.py: Removed the last remnants of the ini file thing.

2003-02-13 20:53  willhelm

	* contrib/plugins/pycalendar.py: Grumble grumble.

2003-02-13 00:51  wari

	* pyblosxom.ini: Removed this file as it's no longer in use by
	  pyblosxom

2003-02-11 16:42  bwinton

	* contrib/plugins/firstdaydiv.py: Add comments, and remove
	  extraneous ;s

2003-02-11 15:54  wari

	* ChangeLog, config.py: Updated config.py, no longer using Windows
	  INI configuration, there are less options now in config.py too.
	  Minor update in pyblosxom.py to not use tb_data as a mandatory
	  config option.

2003-02-11 09:56  wari

	* ChangeLog, contrib/autoping.py, contrib/entryparsers/README,
	  contrib/entryparsers/py.py:
	  * Added a contrib/entryparsers/ directory and basically store what
	    we can handle over there. Users get a standard txt.py entryparser as
	  default
	  * Added a modified version of autoping code from Sam Ruby that's
	    cache and entryparsers compliant. Sadly you need to modify one line
	    in the code that states where you installed pyblosxom (This is not
	  in config)

2003-02-10 11:55  wari

	* ChangeLog: Added the concept of entryparsers. Why? I needed
	  external tools to get access to entry data without rewriting parsing
	  code all over again. I also want to support more extensions other
	  than plain old text files.

2003-02-10 00:58  twl

	* contrib/plugins/lucene/: README, lucene.py,
	  bin/BlosxomIndexer.class, bin/BlosxomIndexer.java,
	  bin/LuceneSearch.class, bin/LuceneSearch.java, bin/index.sh,
	  bin/search.sh: Initial checkin of lucene plugin

2003-02-08 17:05  wari

	* ChangeLog: Minor optimization made - only read files if entry is
	  not cached

	  Added caching infrastructure for pyblosxom, the older config,
	  py['enable_cache'] is no longer in effect. To enable cache two
	  config params are needed,

	  py['cacheDriver'] - the driver to use py['cacheConfig'] - Anything
	                      that's needed by the driver, see driver's documentation for that.

	  Two drivers added, standard file pickler as shelve driver.

2003-02-07 03:39  wari

	* ChangeLog, config.py: Fixed error caused by cgiwrap utility,
	  which sets PATH_INFO even if it's empty

2003-02-06 19:14  bwinton

	* contrib/mt2blosxom.py: Handle entries and comments with dashes in
	  them, as long as they're not 5 or 8 dashes on a line by themselves.

2003-02-06 15:07  wari

	* contrib/plugins/pyarchives.py: Added configurable flavour targets
	  to archive links and some __doc__

	  blacklist updates take effect

	  pyfilenamemtime.py: Previous plugins from libs/plugins/

2003-02-02 12:35  wari

	* INSTALL: Updated installation file with better instructions on
	  .htaccess

2003-02-02 12:28  wari

2003-01-29 12:12  wari

	* contrib/plugins/firstdaydiv.py: Plugin that changes the way dates
	  are rendered in pyblosxom

2003-01-28 16:09  wari

	* ChangeLog: Added configuration override feature in flavours. This
	  allows users to modify their main configuration based on the
	  templates' needs.

2003-01-27 10:42  wari

	* ChangeLog: Changelog update

2003-01-22 15:27  wari

	* ChangeLog: Changed the text/xml detection just in case someone
	  wants to use application/rss+xml as the content-type for rss feeds.
	  This will ensure that anything that ends with xml will be have the
	  content 'sanitized' with escaped < & > for xml. See
	  http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1142.html for details

2003-01-21 07:51  twl

	* contrib/plugins/logstats.py: The plugin for displaying the list
	  of referrers and other log based statistics Requires a change in
	  tools.py in order to be compatible with logrequest.py - the
	  logRequest chain should be using executeHandler not executeTransform

2003-01-18 18:21  wari

	* contrib/plugins/logrequest.py: Modified Files:
	  	libs/api.py libs/pyblosxom.py libs/tools.py Added Files:
	  	contrib/plugins/logrequest.py

	  Made logRequest into a callback API call. This allows for
	  statistical information to be logged via a callback chain. Direct
	  analysis of data can be done directly based on the current request.
	  This eliminates the need to actually analyze the log files that may
	  take some plugins, too long to process.

2003-01-15 14:38  wari

2003-01-15 14:30  wari

2003-01-11 05:19  wari

	* config.py, pyblosxom.cgi, xmlrpc.cgi: Split up the configuration,
	  pyblosxom and xmlrpc into three different files config.py can be
	  called anytime by any modules now, we can seperate data and program
	  clearly. There's still some structural cleanups to do though.
