	* Made Conditional HTTP as a user option

2002-11-23 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* 3rd Revision release
	* Changes in preformatters. All preformatters now resides in
	  libs/preformatters/ directory. The do not have the preformatter_
	  prefix in the filename anymore. Preformatters should still work
	  without changes except for the filename. If possible (for the
	  future) preformatters should subclass PreFormatterBase
	* Entry bugs fixed, if you set a date or category in PATH_INFO, you
	  should get a full list of entries other than just py['num_entries']
	* Support for Etag and Last-Modified. Should save some bandwidth here.
	  Unfortunately not a user definable option yet
	* Pyblosxom now generates 404 errors when a query returns no entries
	* Added 404_handler.py in contrib directory for users interested in
	  Funky Caching
	* Added an excellent preformatter from John Abe
	* Added a funky preformatter script by Abe Fettig
	* pyarchives.py is now located in libs/plugins/ directory, to clean up
	  distribution as well as for future expansion
	* added logRequest() method in libs/tools.py. Look at pyblosxom.py on
	  how to activate it (grep logRequest pyblosxom.py). This is useful if
	  you cannot get access to your own raw http logs. Log format is NCSA
	  httpd compatible, so you can use tools like webalizer to analyze
	  your log files.
	* NOT in this version - Fixes for Windows Webservers. See - 
	  http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/py_stuff/thingsTodo/pyblosxom_for_Win32_.html

	
2002-11-03 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* 2nd Revision release
	* Added fix to reading files that pyblosxom cannot read by Nick
	* Flavour Overrides implementation, requested by Wam and done by Nick
	* Default Parser implementation (by Nick as well)
	* Code splitup in bite sized chunks
	* You can add new variables just by using #var stuff in your entries,
	  useful for "who's responsible" in blogs
	* Pickles cache files, make pyblosxom really fast (Disabled by
	  default)
	* Improved date handling instead of a boring <span>, you can now use
	  divs, see date_header and date_footer in flavours (request and
	  partly coded by Juri Pakaste of Straw RSS parser tool)
	* Includes code to show Monthly archives (see pyarchives.py)
	  enabled by:
	        from libs import pyarchives
		          self.py['archivelinks'] =
		pyarchives.genLinearArchive(self.py['datadir'],
			  self.py['base_url'])
	  so you can use $archivelinks in your flavours. Comment out the two
	  lines in libs/pyblosxom.py to disable
	* Murdered more bugs too minor to list out
			   

2002-09-15 Wari Wahab <pyblosxom@wari.per.sg>
	* 1st Revision Release - pyblosxom 0+5i_rev1
	
	* Fixed sorting mechanism so that it's blagg compatible
	
	* New $tags to support better permalinks, these are:
	$base_url      - URL of pyblosxom
	$file_path     - Path right up to the filename, without .txt extension
	$absolute_path - Directory name without filename attached

	* ESF format added in by default:
	See http://www.aquarionics.com/nodes/view.php?name=esf

	* Links to posts now supports full pathname + flavour:
	eg: http://roughingit.subtlehints.net/pyblosxom/category/filename.flavour
	Where flavour is html, rss3, esf or many others possible with
	templates

	* Supports caching of pages that uses a preformatter (Disabled by default):
	This speeds up rendering the pages especially if the preformatters are
	very show.

	* Configuration using Windows style INI:
	Really helps if you upgrade pyblosxom a lot and hate changing data in
	the code, just edit *configFile* variable to point to your INI file

	* XML-RPC interface, supports bloggerAPI:
	Disabled by default, requires the blogs directory to be writable by
	the webserver, different categories shows up as differing blogIDs,
	tested with w.bloggar and jericho
