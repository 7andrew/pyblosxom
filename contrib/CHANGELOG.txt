Changes between contributed pack 1.2.1 and 1.2.2
================================================

 * New CHANGELOG.txt file which describes the changes between this version
   and the last as well as compatability and behavior issues.

 * New README.txt file which describes what's in the contributed plugins
   pack, where you can find it, and various other things about the contributed
   plugins pack.

 * pycategories now has two new properites "category_start" which gets
   printed once before printing the category list and "category_finish"
   which gets printed once after printing the category list.  Additionally,
   the default values for "category_begin" and "category_end" were fixed.
   This makes the default output for pycategories (x)html compliant.
   Thanks Joseph!

 * comments no longer shows comments by default!  In order to view comments
   for a given entry, you must append "showcomments=yes" to the querystring.
   THIS IS NOT A BACKWARDS-COMPATIBLE CHANGE!

 * comments no longer has documentation for the unused comments-rejected-words
   property.

 * comments no longer requires the email field.

 * w3cdate plugin now provides $w3cdate in head and foot templates.  It no
   longer requires PyXML.  Thanks to Steven and Matej!

==============================================

 * overhauled pycategories plugin (see documentation at top of file for more
   details).
