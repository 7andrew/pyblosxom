Changes between contributed pack 1.2.2 and 1.3
==============================================

General

 * Added release dates to CHANGELOG.txt file.

 * Fixed all logging to use the new functions in PyBlosxom 1.3.

comments

 * Adjusted the behavior so that comments are shown if "showcomments=yes" 
   is in the querystring or if the pyblosxom request is for a specific 
   blog entry (as opposed to a category with only one blog entry in it).  
   In doing this, I moved the code from cb_pathinfo to cb_prepare. 
   Thanks to Matt Weber for the idea!
     
 * Removed the "showcomments=yes" from the comment-form html code.

 * Fixes to allow the comments plugin work with Python 2.2.  Thanks
   Nathan!

 * Adjusted the documentation text to make it clearer that the bit
   about what properties each entry needs to have applies only to
   developers.  Added __description__ and __url__ information.

 * Fixed issues with rendering.  Also removed the "if this is rss,
   then don't do stuff".

 * Fixed an issue where if the config.py file doesn't have blog_encoding
   set, the comments plugin would die.

 * Fixed a security problem where the url and author fields were not
   getting sanitized.  (Thanks Tung Wai Yip!)

 * Unfixed the url not getting sanitized--we already remove html from
   it and sanitize unnecessarily adds an <a href...> </a> to it.

 * Re-added the logging code that the comments plugin uses when things
   go sour.

pycategories

 * Fixed a cosmetic issue where an extra / was getting added to the
   root url

 * Fixed a problem where the finish template was incorrectly pulling
   from the category_finish config property.  Thanks Rob!

 * Fixed a problem where the totals weren't being counted correctly.
   Thanks Rob!

rst entryparser

 * Added two configurable options to the rst entryparser.  The first 
   sets the starting level for rendered heading elements.  The second 
   enables and disables the promotion of a lone top-level section title 
   to the document title.  Thanks Jan-Wijbrand!

 * Fixed the rst entryparser to handle metadata.  Thanks to spanezz!


Changes between contributed pack 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 (21 June, 2005)
================================================================

General

 * New CHANGELOG.txt file which describes the changes between this version
   and the last as well as compatability and behavior issues.

 * New README.txt file which describes what's in the contributed plugins
   pack, where you can find it, and various other things about the contributed
   plugins pack.

genericwiki

 * Matej updated genericwiki so that it works as an entryparser as well as
   a preformatter.  Will fixed up the documentation.  genericwiki was moved
   from the preformatter directory to the entryparser directory.  Thanks Matej!

pycategories

 * Now has two new properites "category_start" which gets printed once before 
   printing the category list and "category_finish" which gets printed once 
   after printing the category list.  Additionally, the default values for 
   "category_begin" and "category_end" were fixed.  This makes the default 
   output for pycategories (x)html compliant.  Thanks Joseph!

comments

 * comments no longer shows comments by default!  In order to view comments
   for a given entry, you must append "showcomments=yes" to the querystring.
   THIS IS NOT A BACKWARDS-COMPATIBLE CHANGE!  Thanks David!

 * comments no longer has documentation for the unused comments-rejected-words
   property.

 * comments no longer requires the email field.

 * all the flavour templates for the comments plugin have been updated.

 * We cleaned up the comment error messages so they're useful to the user.
   Thanks Nathaniel!

w3cdate

 * w3cdate plugin now provides $w3cdate in head and foot templates.  It no
   longer requires PyXML.  Thanks to Steven and Matej!


Changes between contributed pack 1.2 and 1.2.1 (07 May, 2005)
=============================================================

 * bunch of fixes to comments and trackback plugins.

 * overhauled pycategories plugin (see documentation at top of file for more
   details).

 * added licensing information to files and updated some documentation.
