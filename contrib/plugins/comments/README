To install comments:

1. Install plugins/comments.py in your lib/plugins directory

2. If you want trackbacks, install trackback.cgi in your pyblosxom 
   directory and make it executable as a CGI.  The CGI must be callable
   via a URI on your blog site. 

3. If you want pingbacks, install xmlrpcplugins/pingback.py in your
   lib/xmlrpcplugins directory

4  In config.py, 
   add 'comments' to py['load_plugins']

   Comments are stored in a directory which will parallel the data
   directory.  The comments themselves are stored as XML files named
   entryname-datetime.suffix.  The comment system allows you to specify
   the directory where the comment directory tree will stored, and the
   suffix used for comment files.

   set py['comment_dir'] to the directory (in your data directory)
   where you want the comments to be stored.  The default value is a
   directory named 'comments' in your data directory.

   set py['comment_ext'] to the change comment file extension.  The
   default file extension is 'cmt'

5  The comment system can notify you via e-mail when new
   comments/trackbacks/pingbacks are posted.  If you want to enable this 
   feature, create the following config.py entries:

   py['comment_smtp_server'] - your SMTP server
   py['comment_smtp_from'] - the address sending the notification
   py['comment_smtp_to'] - the address receiving the notification

   set for e-mail notification stuff - fix vars

6. Copy the flavour files from the flavours directory.  There are
   flavours for .html and rss.  You should copy both.  The comment-story
   template is used to format a single entry that has comments .  The
   comment template is used to format a single
   comment/trackback/pingback.  The comment-form template provides the
   form used to enter new comments.

7. Edit the comment-story, comment, and comment-form templates.  You
   will have to adjust trackback URI's to match your webserver
   configuration.  Variables that are available are:

   Available in the story and comment-story templates:
   $num_comments - Contains an integer count of the number of comments
   associated with this entry
   
   Available in the comment template:
   $cmt_title - the title of the comment
   $cmt_description - the content of the comment or excerpt of the trackback/pingback
