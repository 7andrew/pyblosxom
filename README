==================
 PyBlosxom Readme
==================

Summary
=======

PyBlosxom is a file-based blogging system in the spirit of Blosxom.
PyBlosxom uses directory tree to represent the category hierarchy.
All entries in a PyBlosxom blog are text files where the first line is
the title of the blog entry and the rest is the body of the entry.

PyBlosxom isn't for everyone.

PyBlosxom runs as a CGI script and WSGI application.

PyBlosxom can run as a "static renderer" and compile your blog into
HTML pages for any web server.  This is a good solution for blogs with
millions of entries or servers that are really slow or don't have a
way to run applications.

PyBlosxom supports templates (called flavours) to change the look and
feel of your blog.

PyBlosxom supports plugins to modify the existing default behavior.


How to install PyBlosxom
========================

Look at the ``install_*.txt`` documents in the ``docs/`` directory.
Pick the one that matches the kind of installation you're looking for.

If you're upgrading from a previous PyBlosxom version, read
``CHANGELOG`` which will describe the differences between PyBlosxom
versions and tell you things you need to change.


How to find comprehensive documentation
=======================================

There's a series of text files in the ``docs/`` directory which
comprise the current state of the PyBlosxom manual at the time of this
release.

The most current version of the manual can be found on the `PyBlosxom
web-site <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/>`_ .
