Summary
=======

PyBlosxom is a file-based blogging system in the spirit of Blosxom.
PyBlosxom uses directory tree to represent the category hierarchy.  All 
entries in a PyBlosxom blog are text files where the first line is the 
title of the blog entry and the rest is the body of the entry.

PyBlosxom isn't for everyone.  If you're not at all interested in hacking
to make things work, then PyBlosxom probably isn't for you.

PyBlosxom runs as a CGI script, a WSGI application and in various other
web application configurations.  Some are better supported than others.
Some haven't been tested yet.

If PyBlosxom performs poorly on your web server or if you can't run it
as a web application, you can use PyBlosxom to statically render your
blog into html files.

PyBlosxom supports flavours to change the look and feel of your blog.

PyBlosxom supports plugins to modify the existing default behavior.


How to install PyBlosxom
========================

Look at the ``install*.txt`` documents in the ``docs/`` directory.  Pick 
the one that matches the kind of installation you're looking for.

Additionally, community members maintain recipes for installing PyBlosxom
in other environments.  These recipes are on the PyBlosxom web-site in the
wiki.

If you're upgrading PyBlosxom versions, read ``CHANGELOG`` which will 
describe the differences between PyBlosxom versions and point out things 
that you'll need to do when upgrading from one version to the next.


How to find comprehensive documentation
=======================================

There's a series of text files in the ``docs/`` directory which comprise
the current state of the PyBlosxom manual at the time of this release.

The most current version of the manual can be found on the `PyBlosxom
web-site <http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/>`_ .


How to get help
===============

On our web-site we have information about our mailing lists.  Send an email 
to our pyblosxom-users mailing list if you have questions that you are unable 
to find answers to.

Additionally, we hang out on IRC at ``#pyblosxom`` on ``irc.freenode.net``.


How to report bugs, send in patches, fix problems
=================================================

We really appreciate people helping out.  

If you discover a problem with PyBlosxom, please log it in our bug-tracker_.

.. _bug-tracker: http://sf.net/tracker/?atid=517918&group_id=67445

If you can additionally fix it, attach a patch file to the bug or
send the patch as an attachment to the pyblosxom-devel mailing list.
Please make sure to describe the details of the problem you are fixing.


How to run unit tests
=====================

We use nose_ for test discovery.  You'll need to have that installed to 
run our tests.

.. _nose: http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/

To run the tests, execute::

   nosetests --verbose --include unit
   nosetests --verbose --include functional

To run tests with coverage_, you'll need coverage, too.

.. _coverage: http://nedbatchelder.com/code/modules/coverage.html

To run the tests with coverage, execute::

   nosetests --verbose --with-coverage --cover-package=Pyblosxom \
             --include unit
   nosetests --verbose --with-coverage --cover-package=Pyblosxom \
             --include functional

If you would like to add tests to the test suite, please do and send us
patches!
