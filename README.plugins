Inside the contrib/ directory, you'll see the plugins/ directory. To install
a given plugin, move the plugin file you want from the contrib/ directory
to the libs/plugins/ directory of your installation.

Some plugins take effect immediately, like the conditionalhttp.py and the
statusnotfound.py. Some requires a little bit more information in using it,
like files to store data, or some variables to put inside your flavour
templates.  Do read the plugin file itself to see what extra steps you need 
to do before installing it.
