=====================
 Upgrading PyBlosxom
=====================

This walks through upgrading PyBlosxom from a previous version.


Before upgrading
================

First, read through the What's New documentation which includes
pointers to users and plugin developers regarding changes between
older versions and newer versions.

This is in the ``WHATSNEW`` file.

If you're reading this online, the changelog is :ref:`here <whatsnew>`.

To be safe, install PyBlosxom locally and test your blog configuration
and plugins to make sure everything works with the new version.


Upgrading site-wide
===================

If you have `pip`_, then do::

    pip install --upgrade pyblosxom

If you don't have `pip`_, but do have `easy_install`_, then do::

    easy_install -U pyblosxom


.. _pip: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
.. _easy_install: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools


Upgrading locally
=================

First, activate your virtual environment.

If you have `pip`_, then do::

    pip install --upgrade pyblosxom

If you don't have `pip`_, but do have `easy_install`_, then do::

    easy_install -U pyblosxom


.. _pip: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
.. _easy_install: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
