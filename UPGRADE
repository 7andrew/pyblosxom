Summary
=======

This document walks through upgrading PyBlosxom from a previous version.


Before upgrading
================

Check the notes on the web-site to make sure that you meet the minimum 
requirements.

To be safe, install PyBlosxom locally and test your blog configuration and 
plugins to make sure everything works with the new version.

Make sure you read the ``CHANGELOG`` file which includes pointers to users
and plugin developers regarding changes between older versions and newer
versions.


System-wide upgrade
===================

At the command line, type::

    easy_install -U pyblosxom


Individual upgrade
==================

Download the new PyBlosxom ``.tar.gz`` file, extract it and point your
scripts to the directory of the new version.
