==============================
Installing PyBlosxom on Debian
==============================

Summary
=======

On Debian and Debian derivatives there's a pyblosxom package which
does most of the setup for you.

This will create a ``/etc/pyblosxom/`` directory which has your
``config.py`` file in it.

The ``pyblosxom.cgi`` file is in ``/usr/lib/cgi-bin/``.


You can follow the main installation instructions from here.
