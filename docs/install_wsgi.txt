Summary
=======

As of PyBlosxom 1.2, PyBlosxom has support for WSGI.
As of PyBlosxom 1.4, WSGI support has been folded into the main codebase
(as opposed to being a separate wsgi_app.py file).


Dependencies
============

* Pyblosxom 1.2 or a later version
* If you're running a version of Python less than 2.5, then you need
  the wsgiref library from http://svn.eby-sarna.com/wsgiref/

.. Note::

   It's better if you're using PyBlosxom 1.4 or later.


Setup
=====

If you're using PyBlosxom 1.2 or 1.3.x:

1. copy the file ``wsgi_app.py`` from ``web/`` into the directory where
   your ``pyblosxom.cgi`` file is.

2. create your web application using the ``application`` function in
   ``wsgi_app.py``.


If you're using PyBlosxom 1.4 or later:

1. create your web application using the ``PyBlosxomWSGIApp`` class in
   the ``Pyblosxom.pyblosxom`` module.
