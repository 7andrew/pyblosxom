====================
Installing PyBlosxom
====================

This guide walks through two different ways to install PyBlosxom:
system-wide and individual.

If this file doesn't meet your needs, ask us on the pyblosxom-users
mailing list or on IRC.  Information on both is on the website_.

.. _website: http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/

.. Note::

    If you're testing PyBlosxom, use ``virtualenv`` and deploy
    with Paste.  It'll save you a lot of time and it's easy to
    clean up afterwards.


Requirements
============

Minimally, PyBlosxom requires Python 2.3 to install.

PyBlosxom is well supported on GNU/Linux, probably works on Mac OSX,
and might work on Windows.

PyBlosxom works with any web-server as a CGI application, works as
a WSGI application, and might work in other contexts.


Install
=======

easy_install
------------

Best way to install PyBlosxom is with *easy_install*.

If you don't have easy_install installed, you can install it and
PyBlosxom by downloading the script from
http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py and running::

    python ez_setup.py pyblosxom

If you do have *easy_install* installed, run::

    easy_install pyblosxom

If you don't want to install PyBlosxom system-wide, we encourage that
you use `virtualenv`_.

.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv


Source install
--------------

You can download PyBlosxom from 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=67445 .
Extract the ``tar.gz`` file.

Instructions for checking PyBlosxom out from SVN are at
http://sourceforge.net/scm/?type=svn&group_id=67445 .  Generally,
*trunk* is unstable but any of the tags are stable.

Run::

    python setup.py install

to install PyBlosxom to your system.


virtualenv
----------

If you don't want to install PyBlosxom system-wide, we encourage that
you use `virtualenv`_.

.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

FIXME - need instructions here


Creating a blog
===============

To create a blog, do::

    pyblosxom-cmd create ./blog/

That generates the directory structure, required files, and a first
post in the ``./blog/`` directory.


Deploying
=========

There are a bunch of ways to deploy your blog.  See the chapters
on deployment for documented options.


Post-install
============

After you finish installing PyBlosxom, you should sign up on the
*pyblosxom-users* mailing list.

Additionally, please hop on the ``#pyblosxom`` IRC channel on
``irc.freenode.net`` and say hi.  It'll almost certainly help you get
acquainted with PyBlosxom and it'll reduce the amount of time it takes
to get your blog up and going.
