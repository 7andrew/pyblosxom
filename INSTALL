Summary
=======

There are a variety of ways to install PyBlosxom and they differ in what

Several installation methods are in the ``docs/`` directory.

If you don't see an installation file that matches your needs, ask us on
the pyblosxom-users mailing list (http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/static/contact).
