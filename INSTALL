Installation
============

Note to people testing PyBlosxom
--------------------------------

If you're testing PyBlosxom, do an individual installation.


System-wide installation
------------------------

If you have easy_install installed, run::

    easy_install pyblosxom

If you don't have easy_install installed, you can install it and PyBlosxom by
downloading the script from http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py and
running::

    python ez_setup.py pyblosxom


Individual installation
-----------------------

1. Follow the links at http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/ to download PyBlosxom.

2. Extract the contents of the ``.tar.gz`` file.

When you use PyBlosxom things, you'll need to add the path to the ``pyblosxom``
to the Python path.

You can do this in Python scripts by appending the diectory to ``sys.path``::

    import sys
    sys.path.append("/path/to/pyblosxom")

You can do this by setting the ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable, too.  For
example::

    PYTHONPATH=/home/joe/pyblosxom/ python pyblcmd --help

detailed on the website_.  If you can't find instructions for deploying
PyBlosxom in the manner of your choosing, ask us on the pyblosxom-devel
mailing list or on IRC.
