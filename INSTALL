For a simple installation, extract pyblosxom.cgi, config.py and the libs/
directory into your cgi-bin/. If you do not like the libs/ to be in the
cgi-bin, you can place it elsewhere outside of DocumentRoot of your web server
and comment out the 4th line in pyblosxom.cgi to reflect where your path is.

import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/where/lib/directory/is')

For bloggerAPI and other (not planned yet) xmlrpc capabilities, copy xmlrpc.cgi
to your cgi-/bin directory as well. Be sure that config.py is there as well.
