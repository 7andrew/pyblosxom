For a simple installation, extract pyblosxom.cgi and the libs/ directory into
your cgi-bin/. If you do not like the libs/ to be in the cgi-bin, you can place
it elsewhere outside of DocumentRoot of your web server and comment out the 4th
line in pyblosxom.cgi to reflect where your path is.

sys.path.append('/path/to/where/lib/directory/is')
